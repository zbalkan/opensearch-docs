# YAML Configuration Documentation

A naive approach to generate documentation from YAML files which can be integrated into CI-CD pipeline. In short, JavaDoc or doxygen for YAMl.

The `defaults.yml` file used as an example is extracted from OpenSearch configuration.

## Generated docs

The documentation is under `./docs` directory. Under screenshots, ou can get both partial and full views.
