# OpenSearch Configuration Documentation

A naive approach to generate documentation from opensearch.yml which can be integrated into CI-CD pipeline.

## Generated docs

The documentation is under `./docs` directory. Under screenshots, ou can get both partial and full views.

## Reference

The POC is based on the issue [214](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues/214)
